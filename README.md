 Antifouling paint is a material used on the hull of boats and other surfaces to prevent the accumulation of microorganisms and algae, in a process called biofouling. This paint is known to contain trace heavy metals, such as copper, which can impact the normal physiological processes of organisms. In this project, we tested the effects of antifouling paint on the stress ecophysiology of hairy shore crabs through righting time and lactate levels. The following hypothesis was tested: increases in exposure to antifouling paint will increase the righting time and lactate levels within the hairy shore crabs. Our experiment consisted of three experimental groups and one control group, each containing 5 individuals. The temperature and salinity were kept constant throughout the experiment, 15â„ƒ and 33ppt, respectively. Three exposures to antifouling paint were tested: 2cm2/L, 8cm2/L, and 32cm2/L. The crabs were exposed for 1 week; righting time and lactate levels (through hemolymph extractions) were then taken. Our results indicate a positive correlation between exposure to antifouling paint and righting time. However, a negative correlation between exposure and lactate levels was observed.
